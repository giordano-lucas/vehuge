# Vehuge : A Sum product Network Implementation in Scala

####

⚠ Notice of Development ⚠ The developpement was put on hold. It is likely to start again in december 2021.

####

Vehuge, an open-source Scala library providing a simple interface to inference, learning and manipulation routines for deep and tractable probabilistic models called Sum-Product Networks (SPNs. 

The goal of the library is eventually to provide :

* Fast and easy SPNs creation both from data and through a domain specific language (DSL). 
* Several probabilistic inference routines like computing marginals, conditionals and (approximate) most probable explanations (MPEs) along with sampling.
* Utilities for serializing, plotting and structure statistics on an SPN.
